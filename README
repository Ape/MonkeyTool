MonkeyTool
-----------

MonkeyTool is an Arch Linux based recovery linux distribution. It has a
customized set of recovery and hacking tools. MonkeyTool is a live-only
distribution: it can't be installed. Typically it is booted from a CD or a USB
device.

The image must be created on an Arch Linux system, because it takes the binaries
from the host system. Moreover, the host system determines the architecture and
version of the binaries.

To create the image use the following command:
	# make all

Before creating a new image you should probably clean the work folder first:
	# make clean

Note that these commands must be ran as root.

You can download a binary version of 64-bit MonkeyTool:

The image can be burned in to a CD or a USB device using utilities like
dd.
