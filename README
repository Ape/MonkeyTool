MonkeyTool is a text-based Linux distribution made for system recovery. It may

MonkeyTool is based on Arch Linux and it must be built on an Arch Linux system.
If you are not running one, you could build MonkeyTool in a virtual machine.

The scripts for building MonkeyTool are licensed under the ISC license. Please

To create the image use the following command:
	make

It will ask for the root password with sudo for certain operations. You should
not run "make" directly as root.

You can customize the package list by editing packages.list. The lines starting
with an asterisk (*) are fetched from AUR.

The image can be burned in to a CD or a USB device using utilities like
dd.
